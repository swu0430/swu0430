### Hi I'm Steven ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a Master's of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) degree as well as an MBA at Wharton. I'm an aspiring software engineer who is passionate about improving my skills as a full stack developer. Outside of programming, I'm a :tennis: and :rocket: enthusiast!

### What I'm focusing on :hammer_and_wrench:
Currently, I'm working as a GUI developer for a Penn Engineering robotics research team at [Kod*Lab](https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/) to maintain a website for collecting experimental data from expert geoscientists using primarily React.

### Technologies I've used :computer:

### That's all for now! :v:
Before you go, perhaps you'll enjoy a custom word/picture version of [Codenames](https://detective-dingo.web.app/#/). This was my first web app project and a fun quarantine project for friends based on one of my favorite board games. 

Anyways, thanks for stopping by! But mainly, stay classy.
